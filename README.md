# missionaries-and-cannibals
Missionaries and Cannibals game in Python

This project is a Python implementation of the classic **Missionaries and Cannibals** problem.  
The goal is to safely transport all missionaries and cannibals across a river while following the game rules.

The project is implemented using Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and step-by-step execution.

# Problem Rules
- A boat can carry at most **two people** at a time.
- At no point can cannibals outnumber missionaries on either side of the river.
- If cannibals outnumber missionaries on a side, the missionaries get eaten.
- The goal is to move everyone safely to the opposite side.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab)

Install Jupyter if you don’t have it:
